Version 2.1.16
==============
Fixed the following problem.
- Passing a macro substitution string from one related display to
  another related display with unresolved variable(s) crashes medm.

  e.g.

    1. 33id.adl calls f1.adl with parameters P=id,In=inputCard0
    2. f1.adl calls f1_calib.adl with parameters P=$(P),In=$(In),Out=$(Out)
    3. medm quits with a core dump since $(Out) is not defined in f1.adl


Version 2.1.15
==============
Fixed the following problem.
- use "save as" to save a file in a directory with no write permission.
  Medm crashes with SIGSEGV message.

Version 2.1.14
==============
Fixed the following problems on both solaris and SGI platform.
- bring up MEDM without any display, selecting any object in object
  palette crashes medm.
- toggle back to edit mode, selecting any object in object palette
  crashes medm.
- close all displays, selecting any object in object palette crashes
  medm.
