Version 2.1.17
==============
Fixed the following problem.
- Remove one of the two limits of how many related display buttons you can
  create. However, there is still a limit of how many controllers and monitors
  (except text update) you can create.  The limit is 1000. If the limit
  is execeeded, the medm eventually crashes itself.  This will be fixed
  in 2.2.x and the number of objects will be constrainted by how much
  memory is available.

Version 2.1.16
==============
Fixed the following problem.
- Passing a macro substitution string from one related display to
  another related display with unresolved variable(s) crashes medm.

  e.g.

    1. 33id.adl calls f1.adl with parameters P=id,In=inputCard0
    2. f1.adl calls f1_calib.adl with parameters P=$(P),In=$(In),Out=$(Out)
    3. medm quits with a core dump since $(Out) is not defined in f1.adl


Version 2.1.15
==============
Fixed the following problem.
- use "save as" to save a file in a directory with no write permission.
  Medm crashes with SIGSEGV message.

Version 2.1.14
==============
Fixed the following problems on both solaris and SGI platform.
- bring up MEDM without any display, selecting any object in object
  palette crashes medm.
- toggle back to edit mode, selecting any object in object palette
  crashes medm.
- close all displays, selecting any object in object palette crashes
  medm.
