Version 2.2.5
=============
- Fix another 24 bit color bug.
- the image now works correctly on a 24 bit X-Server running on PC.
- add a new feature which contributed by desy. An extra entry in
  the shell menu to bring up help for that particular screen.  The 
  help program is specified in the environment variable MEDM_HELP.
   Medm make a system() call with the display name as an argument.

Version 2.2.4
=============
- Fix the following bug :
  Loading the second or any additional displays causes MEDM to add extra
  entries on relatedDisplay, shellCommand, strip chart and cartesian Plot.

Version 2.2.3
=============
- Fix the following bug :
	If you move or resize a composite widget by modifing the x, y, height and
  width in the resource palette, the object will be size to zero.

Version 2.2.2
=============
- Fix a bug which cause warning dialog box failing to release the mouse
  after being closed by user.  This only happens under Open Window Manager.

Version 2.2.1
=============
- Fix a bug which causes MEDM to crash. The problem is related to an 
  uninitialized pointer of composite widget.

Version 2.2.0
=============
- Support a new .adl file format.
  - reduce the file size up to 70%
  - the new file format will compatible with a new Java tool developed by John
    Winans.
  - eliminate the problem of multiple defined of basic attribute and
    dynamic attribute for individual object in .adl file.
- Also support the 2.1.x file format.  By default, medm saves display in the
  new file format.  However, user can save display in the 2.1.x file format.
  To do that, bring up the "save as" file selection dialog from the file
  menu and select the 2.1.x file format.
- polygon and polyine now have a more consistence inheritence characteristic
  with the rest of the graphic objects.
- Add '0x' in front of the hexadecimal number. For hexadecimal format,
  the number is always treated as a unsigned long.  For example, a -1
  will be displayed as 0xffffffff and a 1 will be 0x1.
- Add <string> option to textUpdate and textEntry object. if the pv is an
  character waveform, MEDM will treat the character waveform as a '\0' ended
  character string.  The maximum size of the string is either the size
  of character waveform or 256 character minus the '\0' character, whichever
  is less.
- Select a printer ofter than the default one.  Pull down the file menu,
  select the entry <Printer Setup> and enter the printer name into the
  setup dialog box and press O.K.
- Add a command line switch -bigMousePointer to ask medm to use a bigger mouse
  pointer.


Version 2.1.17
==============
Fixed the following problem.
- Remove one of the two limits of how many related display buttons you can
  create. However, there is still a limit of how many controllers and monitors
  (except text update) you can create.  The limit is 1000. If the limit
  is execeeded, the medm eventually crashes itself.  This will be fixed
  in 2.2.x and the number of objects will be constrainted by how much
  memory is available.

Version 2.1.16
==============
Fixed the following problem.
- Passing a macro substitution string from one related display to
  another related display with unresolved variable(s) crashes medm.

  e.g.

    1. 33id.adl calls f1.adl with parameters P=id,In=inputCard0
    2. f1.adl calls f1_calib.adl with parameters P=$(P),In=$(In),Out=$(Out)
    3. medm quits with a core dump since $(Out) is not defined in f1.adl


Version 2.1.15
==============
Fixed the following problem.
- use "save as" to save a file in a directory with no write permission.
  Medm crashes with SIGSEGV message.

Version 2.1.14
==============
Fixed the following problems on both solaris and SGI platform.
- bring up MEDM without any display, selecting any object in object
  palette crashes medm.
- toggle back to edit mode, selecting any object in object palette
  crashes medm.
- close all displays, selecting any object in object palette crashes
  medm.
